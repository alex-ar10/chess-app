# Queen's Quest Chess App

This chess application is a work in progress, but as of August 09 2023 the main functionality lies in being able to play a game of chess against oneself. The app will only allow legal moves and recognizes check and checkmate.

As this project is the first of this kind that I am tackling, special thanks go out to [@bluepostit](https://github.com/bluepostit) and [@svenson74](https://github.com/svenson74) for their exceptional guidance and support!

## Big Picture To Do's

- Introduce a database to save game data
- Create user authentication and profile page with wins and losses
- Introduce functionality of playing a single game against another user
